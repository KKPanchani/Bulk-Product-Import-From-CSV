Bulk Product Import from CSV Plugin
This plugin allows you to bulk import products into your WooCommerce store using a CSV file. It retrieves new CSV data via an API call each time the "Import Products" button is clicked.

Features:
Custom Column Mapping: Map columns from your CSV file to the corresponding product fields in WooCommerce according to the CSV format.

Product Management:
Option to delete products that are no longer in the CSV.
Automatically set products to out of stock by comparing the CSV data with existing products in the WooCommerce product table.

How It Works:
API Call: The plugin retrieves the latest CSV data through an API call when the "Import Products" button is clicked.
Product Updates: The plugin can delete products not present in the CSV and mark existing products as out of stock, ensuring your inventory is up to date.
